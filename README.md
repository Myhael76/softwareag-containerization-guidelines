Software AG containerization guidelines group best practices, rules and relevant code examples to quickly and correctly set up production-ready solutions based on Software AG products deployed in containers.

## Organization

Th guidelines are layered in 4 sub-domains:

1. General infrastructure & OCI best practices and constraints recognized throughout this repository
2. Product focused guidelines
3. Simple stack guidleines, where basic combinations of products are considered; e.g. Microservices Runtime working with Universal Messaging
4. Complex stack guidelines, where multiple products are used to build complete solutions, such as BPMS based projects

Throughout the documented content, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in [rfc2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119)
